## Microsoft Soundscape

The visually impaired often face difficulties navigating and interacting with their surroundings. [Microsoft Soundscape](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/soundscape/) is a research project that explores the use of innovative audio-based technology to enable people, particularly those with blindness or low vision, to build a richer awareness of their surroundings, thus becoming more confident and empowered to interact with the real world.

## Soundscape Go Prototype

Back in 2019, as a part of our HCI/Software Engineering course at university, our team of three students have designed, prototyped and presented a feature that builds on Soundscape, allowing users to explore any location remotely via a Soundscape-like experience. Much like how Google Street View allows users to see the surroundings of different places on the map, our project allows Soundscape users to explore any location across the world by means of 3D sound & graphics combination. This allows the visually impaired to explore these places without leaving home and gain confidence when navigating new environments.

During the course of the project we have learned and practiced designing computer systems (utilizing cloud services and several REST APIs) as well as designing an application with strict human-computer interaction constraints in mind.
